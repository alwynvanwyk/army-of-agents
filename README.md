# stage-gate-way-of-working
I constantly use Cursor.ai as my IDE for software development. I use a structured prompts way of working that includes 4 stages. Each stage has a unique "STAGE_GATE_PROMPT_PLAN.md" file that provides instructions and examples with regards to building software effectively. This project intends to continuously improve on this way of working.
