# stage-gate-way-of-working
Inspired by Michael Pretorius - thx, bro!
I constantly use Cursor.ai as my IDE for software development. 
I use a structured prompts way of working that includes 4 stages, namely 0-backlog, 1-planning, 2-wip, and 3-done.
Each stage has a unique "STAGE_GATE_PROMPT_PLAN.md" file that provides instructions and examples with regards to building software effectively.
This project intends to continuously improve on this way of working by using Claude, Grok, Gemini, and ChatGPT for critical feedback.
