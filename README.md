# stage-gate-way-of-working
Inspired by Michael Pretorius - thx, bro!
I constantly use Cursor.ai as my IDE for software development. 
I use a structured prompts way of working that includes 4 stages, namely 0-backlog, 1-planning, 2-wip, and 3-done.
Each stage has a unique "STAGE_GATE_PROMPT_PLAN.md" file that provides instructions and examples with regards to building software effectively.
This project intends to continuously improve on this way of working by using Claude, Grok, Gemini, and ChatGPT for critical feedback.

Found a better way of doing this.
- Review Michael's video
    - Create a feature folder
- Review the training material in learnt-a-thing
- Own understanding based on cmtat repo and Medium article
    - Start with PRD

Improvements:
1. Start with a PRD.
2. Analyse the requirements to generate a high-level process flow Mermaid diagram.
3. Design the architecture.
4. Generate a technical specification.
